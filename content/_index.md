<strong>WTF</strong> is a personal information dashboard for your terminal, developed for those who spend most of their day in the command line.

It allows you to monitor systems, services, and important information that you otherwise might keep browser tabs open for, the kinds of things you don't always need visible, but do check in on every now and then.

Keep an eye on your **OpsGenie** schedules, **Google Calendar**, **Git** and **GitHub** repositories, and **New Relic** deployments.

See who's away in **BambooHR**, which **Jira** tickets are assigned to you, and what time it is in Barcelona.

It even has weather. And clocks. And emoji.
